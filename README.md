# Web Development Portfolio

## Description

A personal portfolio site. It was the first website I've written without the use of a CMS in over a decade. It started out as a bare bones submission to complete an assignment, but I've come back to it to polish it up and update it.

## How to use

Download the repository and open index.html in a web browser.
